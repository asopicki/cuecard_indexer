# cuecard_indexer
A simple indexer for cuecards written in a format based on CommonMark

The program will search files in a directory and extract some metadata to an sqlite database 
which can be used to query the cue cards database.

This tool is currently build for my own use but it could well be extended to run on another environment as well. 
The tool is written in Rust.
